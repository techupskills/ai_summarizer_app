            Artificial intelligence has reached a new milestone with the development of large language models that can understand and generate human-like text. These models, trained on vast amounts of data, have shown remarkable capabilities in various tasks including translation, summarization, and creative writing. Companies are now integrating these AI systems into their products and services, revolutionizing how we interact with technology. However, concerns about bias, accuracy, and ethical use remain significant challenges that researchers and developers are actively addressing. The rapid advancement in AI technology promises to transform industries from healthcare to education, but it also raises important questions about the future of work and human-AI collaboration.

            Climate change represents one of the most pressing challenges of our time, with global temperatures rising at an unprecedented rate due to human activities. Recent studies have shown that carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have reached their highest point in over 3 million years, leading to significant changes in weather patterns, sea levels, and ecosystem dynamics. The impacts are already visible through more frequent extreme weather events, melting polar ice caps, and shifts in agricultural productivity. To address this crisis, scientists emphasize the urgent need for comprehensive mitigation strategies including renewable energy adoption, carbon capture technologies, and international cooperation. The window for limiting global warming to 1.5¬∞C above pre-industrial levels is rapidly closing, requiring immediate and sustained action from governments, businesses, and individuals worldwide.

Operating margins improved to 18.5%, reflecting successful cost optimization initiatives and operational efficiency gains. International markets contributed 45% of total revenue, with particularly strong performance in Asia-Pacific regions. Looking ahead, the company expects continued growth momentum, supported by new product launches and expanding market opportunities.

    ### üéØ How It Works
    This app uses **Facebook's BART** (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers) model, 
    fine-tuned on CNN/DailyMail dataset for abstractive summarization. Unlike extractive 
    summarization that selects existing sentences, BART generates new sentences that capture 
    the essence of the original text.
    
    ### üí° Tips for Best Results
    - Use well-structured text (articles, reports, documents)
    - Minimum 100 characters for meaningful summaries
    - Longer texts may be automatically chunked for processing
    - Adjust summary length based on your needs
